# SiteFarm Subtheming Recipes

This repo is a companion to the video series on advanced subtheming in SiteFarm.

https://vimeo.com/channels/sitefarmsubthemerecipes

The final code of each video is in its own branch.

## Viewing the new code

You can easily see the code specific to each video by switching to its branch in
Github and then on the right side clicking `Compare`. This will show the diff
between the current receipe branch and the master branch which is the state
before any new code was added.

## Want a specific recipe made?

If you have a specific recipe of which you would like to see a video made, feel
free to create an issue here in Github and state what you would like to see.
Perhaps it's something others might be interested in as well.
